# NIC

The Network Interface Card (NIC) allows computers to communicate over a local-area network. A typical NIC is both a physical layer and data link layer device and provides access to the transmission medium, and supports a MAC protocol and an addressing scheme. This code helps in evaluating the performance of a NIC using an event-driven simulator.
